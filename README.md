Transport-related Pollution Database: a case study of Pittsburgh’s Downtown Area


This study developed a prototype SQL database structure that will allow future research to conduct a high-quality study and for local governments to make more efficient decisions for urban development and air quality


A larger sample size is required, and our relational database design is encouraged in future work


The purpose of this study is to emphasize the importance of having SQL data management rather than a traditional Microsoft Excel file which can lead to a better integration of datasets


In our case study of Pittsburgh’s downtown area, our pilot model was showing that such positive correlation is not yet significant, future research should be able to utilize proposed database design and collect more samples and develop a more novelty model to establish a relationship between Air Quality Index (AQI) and automobile traffic density


We agree with the editor's suggestion that more detailed air quality measurements, such as those from the Pittsburgh particulate matter (PM) Supersite led by CMU scientists (Presto & Gu, 2019), may provide a more fruitful dataset to explore this relationship
